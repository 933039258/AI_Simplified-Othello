Assignment 2 Simplified Othello


To run the code by Terminal, here is some command for you:

1. make

2. othello player1 player2

(player1 and player2 should be human or minimax.)


By the way, I downloaded and used the provided code by Wong in assignment 2 and filled in MinimaxPlayer.cpp and MinimaxPlayer.h file.
